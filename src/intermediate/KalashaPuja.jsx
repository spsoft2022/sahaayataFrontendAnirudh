    content="Kalasha Pooja is an ancient Indian spiritual practice for the fulfillment of specific desires for welfare of oneself or one's family. It can be easily performed at home with devotion for fulfillment of desires or solving day to day problems like attaining good health, creation of wealth, education, marriage, begetting children, court cases, success in various endeavours etc. and even for moksha for one's ancestors. It is done by procedural observation of prayers, offerings, incantations to the Lord Almighty (normally the Goddess) who is worshipped as the wish fulfilling Kalasha. During the period of performing Kalasha Pooja, one bonds with the Divine Living Presence at one's residence and receives Divine Grace everyday. Kalash Pooja fills the home with sacredness and increases one's bonding with his / her personal God. It also raises one's state of consciousness to higher levels. Besides fulfilling our desires and solving our problems, the Kalash Pooja leads us to a happy way of living in the busy and materialistic world. For understanding the simple procedure of performing the Kalasha Pooja at one's residence, either individually or by inviting a group of friends, please go through the following."/>
