   content="The practice of Soundarya Lahari, an ancient powerful spiritual method is mainly to invoke the power of the Universal Supreme Godhead – regardless of religious practice, faith, which separates humanity from the other in their practice of spiritual beliefs. Soundarya Lahari practice essentially begins with the description of the form of the Supreme Universal One God ( Adi Para Shakti) in its 100 verses scripted and recited in the Sanskrit language – to invoke power, purity and presence of the Divine in our day to day life. Sahaayata offers these sessions from time to time depending on the response and encouragement received from participants. The main idea behind the Soundarya Lahari is to transform our way of living by direct contact and invocation of God with the Supreme Presence. All are encouraged to participate in the event and experience the transformative effect of the incantation of verses from the Soundarya Lahari. Presently, we have regular classes being conducted only in our Sahaayata Centre, Bengaluru. However, Online classes are also conducted to participate from the comfort of one's home."/>
