                  Life has always been a mystery. There are so many questions which we come across and we do not have answers; so many incidents and we have no reasons; so many things and we do not understand why. Strange is the creation. We often wonder how this universe is so systematically organised and working. For example, for ages, the sun rises in the east and sets in the west. It never stopped rising. How are elephants communicating? How are the birds flying 18000 miles from Siberia to the Coromandel coast in South India and lay their eggs and fly back - the eggs hatch and the chicks fly back all the way to Siberia and where did they get the intelligence to go back to their homes. Who gave this intelligence. There are many more for which we do not have answers. To name that Supreme Intelligence, who is formless and can take a form when needed as GOD, the Almighty, the Creator, and the Creation.

                      This workshop is not just a lecture, but a journey and an experiential process in consciousness which leads us to a much evolved and joyous living. All of us sail in the boat of life. We want to make our life very healthy, prosperous, loving, enjoyable, beautiful and happy. All the time we try not to hurt others or not get hurt. We want to maintain good relationships. No person wants problems and sufferings. But none can be free from suffering and problems. But we must know how to overcome problems and suffering. We should first become aware of our problems and analyse the causes, search for solutions and then apply them in our life and be free from them or at least reduce their impact of them in our lives.

                    One, who has a personal need to fulfill which could be due to failing or deteriorating health, isolation in an old age home, physical challenges, unsound mentally, the hungry, poor, jobless migrant populations leading a nomadic life, street kids, menial workers, daily wage labourers, orphans in dire need of a home, education and a dignified life, destitute girls, women, children and taking it a bit ahead, even prisoners and many others. These are categories of a cross section of our own society who are, what we call, under privileged and less fortunate living a hard life.

                    <p>
                      On the other hand, we also have a set of people who are well to do, but lonely as they live away from their children who may have crossed the shores for greener pastures, who are well off but lead a sick, abandoned life as loners. Single parents are another category who have lost purpose and the will to live and are not having a friend circle and depend on caregivers for company.

                    All of us go through various ups and downs in life. When we are happy, we do not feel the need for any Sahaayata (Help).  But in times of despair, we definitely require help. But more often than not, we tend to work on our own and try to solve our issues ourselves, which itself is the right way to do. But there are many situations in everyone's life when we try all our efforts and still fail to solve our issues. We might have tried taking the help of many and still our efforts go in vain.  It is in that situation that we take the help of the Lord or the Divine or the nature or the universe, in whatever way or form we percieve. Ultimately, it is that Supreme Divine who comes to our rescue for which we need to be helpless rather than being desperate. That dependance, dialogue or communication in the form of feelings, seeking, asking etc is what is called prayer.

                    This centre is the vortex of prayers, healings, blessings, life guidance, career – family – marital counseling, besides mainly spiritual emancipation. Designed to provide a homely environment, which is devoted to the larger cause of humanitarian work, it also serves as a spiritual powerhouse to channel one’s life in the path of growth, contribution and success. The material and spiritual life balance is a major focus of this centre and all participants have a major takeaway by associating with the events regularly organized; specially healings and prayers which we are not too sure to handle without the able wise counsel of spiritual teachers. The faculty and trained sahaayaks at the centre have a significant training and exposure to some of India’s most powerful techniques of spiritual practices and are competent to administer the principles, which are life transforming.
