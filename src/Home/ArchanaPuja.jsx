                <p className='archanaheading mb-2'>Meaning </p>
                <p className='archanasub text-secondary'>Archana is a special, personal, abbreviated Puja done by Temple priests in which the name, birth star and family lineage of a devotee are recited to invoke individual guidance and blessings. Archana also refers to chanting the names of the Deity, which is a central part of every puja. The Sanskrit meaning is "honouring, praising."</p>

                <p className='archanaheading mb-2'>Essence</p>
                <p className='archanasub text-secondary'>Sahaayata Vinayaka Archana Puja, though can be conducted on behalf of participants (online / in person) for a focused fulfillment of a desire or deliverance of solution to a problem, the essence of this puja is to make the participants personally participate and go through the ritual themselves in person or remotely, rather than delegating it to a priest. Prayers sent personally to God are more genuine and powerful than sending them through another person with all due respects to the priests who are more knowledgeable and more experienced in their chosen domain. At the same time, the devotee is not experiencing the Divine aspects of sharanagathi (surrender), pavitrata (sacredness), tapana (passion), bhakti (love of god), kruthagnatha (gratitude) etc. as much as it is required which are not only one’s growth in one’s spiritual journey but also are pre-requisites of the prayer.</p>
