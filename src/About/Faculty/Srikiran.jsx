            <div className='d-flex flex-column gap-4'>
                 <p>Born in 1971, Sri Kiran completed his early schooling from a Gurukulashram. He was a university topper in his graduation from Berhampur University, Odisha and has also completed the Intermediate Examination from the prestigious Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. An intense inner calling when he was 25, encouraged him to serve the noble cause of helping humanity to raise to the next level ultimately leading every person to help themselves and help others. He emerges from a lineage of learned and experienced teachers dedicated to the upliftment of their motherland and the world at large.</p>
            <p>He has widely travelled and conducted several lectures, guided meditations and various ‘stress liberating’ courses for various corporate executives, professionals and institutions for over 20 years now, in organizations such as Bombay Stock Exchange, Indian Merchant Chambers, NTPC, BHEL, IOCL, FLO, Nalco, Spic, National Defence Academy, National Police Academy, Airports Authority of India, Godrej & Boyce Pvt Ltd etc. to name a few. He has also conducted several motivating retreats for the youth across the country. His wisdom, coupled with a blessed ability to transfer the state of Divine energies to others, goes far beyond his years and has prompted several institutions to invite him to conduct meditation sessions as well as personal counseling and personality development courses. Kiran ji had addressed several conferences and platforms like Rotary, LIONs etc. People from a wide canvas of social strata and professional backgrounds have directly benefited from him personally. He is presently the founder of Sahaayata, a socio- spiritual organisation with a vision to help all, enabling them to help themselves and help the society at large. Kiran ji is the senior faculty of Sahaayata in the corporate and governance sector.</p>
            <p>In the past, Kiran ji met His Excellency, the then President of India, Late Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam and had a freewheeling discussion on the educational processes within the country. The impressed missile man acknowledged that this noble cause should reach all the students who are the future of the nation.</p>
            <p>The precision of a surgeon accompanied by the playfulness of a mystic finds total expression through his personality as he creates paths through the chaotic human mind process. Stresses find a release rather than a mere management through strategies he adopts.</p>
            <p>Needless to add, layperson, corporate executive and corporate CEO’s / Business Heads alike are left spell bound by his expositions and the transfer of higher energies which increase the levels of consciousness leaving the receiver more efficient, relaxed, energised and successful. Kiran ji is the harbinger of such Divine Energies, which he believes that he receives from the Divine and his masters, in the lives of thousands of people across India</p>
